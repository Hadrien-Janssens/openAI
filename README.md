# 📝 Chatbot UI

This application offers a modern ChatGPT-style interface that allows users to work with multiple AI models at once (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) via the OpenRouter API. Users can create personas, define persistent instructions, add custom tools (shortcuts, predefined prompts), and manage their entire conversation history. The goal is to provide a flexible, fast and extensible workspace for both developers and non-technical users, centralizing all their AI models within a single interface.
